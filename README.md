## What it does

Mizan pulls **18 read-only security signals** from every entity's Microsoft 365 tenant via Microsoft Graph, computes a per-entity **Maturity Index** (0–100), and ranks every entity against a target score you define. It's the one pane of glass for a holding company, ministry, or regulator that oversees dozens to hundreds of sub-organizations — each running their own tenant.

- **Federated visibility** across every consented Microsoft 365 tenant
- **18 Graph signals** — Secure Score, Conditional Access, Identity Protection, Intune compliance, Defender incidents, **Defender Vulnerability Management (CVE posture per device + cross-tenant CVE correlation)**, Purview DLP/IRM/Comm Compliance, Subject Rights Requests, retention/sensitivity labels, SharePoint tenant settings, PIM sprawl, Defender for Identity sensor health, Attack Simulation, Threat Intelligence, label adoption
- **Cross-tenant CVE correlation** — surfaces CVEs present in 2+ consented entities with exposed/remediated device rollups; a federated view no individual CISO can produce
- **Maturity trending** — per-entity daily snapshots with 30/90/180-day chart on the Overview tab
- **Pluggable frameworks** — UAE NESA, KSA NCA, ISR / ISO 27001, or generic
- **Entra ID sign-in + RBAC** — Admin / Analyst / Viewer, 7-day sliding-window session (configurable 8h / 24h / 7d / 30d) with silent Microsoft SSO re-auth on expiry
- **White-label** — organization name, logo (auto background-strip, 100% local), colors, tagline, framework — all in Settings
- **Bilingual** — full English + Arabic, RTL-native
- **Mobile + tablet ready (v2.5.0)** — middleware classifies the device on every request and renders a mobile-optimized chrome (compact topbar + off-canvas drawer, sheet-style modals, safe-area padding for iOS notch + home indicator) for phones, while tablets and desktops keep the persistent-sidebar dashboard chrome unchanged. Override with `?device=mobile|tablet|desktop` for QA or to force a layout. See [docs/14-responsive-and-mobile.md](docs/14-responsive-and-mobile.md).

### Directive mode — regulator write tier (optional, v2.0+)

Deploy with `MIZAN_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=directive` and you also get a second Entra app (provisioned through the setup wizard) holding writable Graph scopes, plus a `/directive` surface for regulators who have authority to harden consented entities. v2.0 ships the full directive write tier on every Graph-reachable surface today + curated coming-soon catalogs for the rest.

**Live in v2.0 — push works, real Graph writes:**

- **Per-entity consent mode** — each entity opts in or stays in observation. Observation entities are never written to, regardless of role.
- **12 Conditional Access baselines** — identity hardening, legacy auth block, risk-based enforcement, session hygiene, device posture. Report-only by default.
- **Custom CA wizard** — 7 steps, no JSON. Cross-tenant + tenant-scoped modes (latter unlocks specific users / groups / named locations / Terms of Use / custom auth strengths via Graph typeahead). Device filter rule builder.
- **13 Intune device-posture baselines** — iOS / Android / Windows / macOS compliance + iOS / Android MAM (no enrolment needed) + Windows BitLocker enforcement + 6 Defender for Endpoint **Attack Surface Reduction rules** (audit mode default).
- **4 SharePoint tenant external-sharing baselines** — strict external sharing, default link Internal+View, domain allow-list, anonymous links off. Singleton model — push only, no rollback (audit captures the diff).
- **IOC push console** — Defender for Endpoint Threat Intelligence indicators (file hash / URL / domain / IPv4 / IPv6) with per-IOC expiration, idempotency by description tag, full rollback.
- **Reactive writes** — incident classification, alert comments, risky-user confirm/dismiss, session revoke, threat submission.
- **Idempotent push** — repeat pushes match by tag and no-op instead of duplicating.
- **Rollback safety** — pre-flight preview reads each policy's current state from Graph, warns if the entity flipped report-only → enabled, per-row deselect, baseline-wide "Remove from ALL entities".
- **Per-entity baseline status** — one-call Graph-tag scan showing which baselines are present in each entity and what state each is in.
- **Audit log** — every directive action captured in `directive_actions` with actor, timestamp, Graph response. Never deleted.

**Coming soon catalogs in v2.0 — UI ready, push disabled until Microsoft Graph API closes the gap:**

DLP (4 baselines), Sensitivity Labels (3), Attack Simulation Training (3), PIM + Identity Governance (5), App Consent Policies (4), Tenant Identity Defaults (6). Catalogs render with an accent "Coming soon" banner; flipping `pushEnabled: true` is the only change needed when each phase's authoring API moves to GA.

**Production hardening:**

- **Cert-based MSAL** — swap `client_secret` for a PEM private key + SHA-1 thumbprint via Settings → App Registration → Certificate. No more shared-secret rotation; cert lifetime is whatever you sign with. Env-var fallback (`AZURE_CLIENT_CERT_THUMBPRINT` + `AZURE_CLIENT_CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM`) for Azure Key Vault deployments. Same option on the user-auth Entra app.
- **`/api/health` endpoint** — DB ping for Azure liveness + monitoring probes. No auth required (probes have no creds; response carries no secrets — just `{ status, deploymentMode, tenantCount, latencyMs }`).
- **Accessibility v1** — skip-to-content link, modal focus trap + restore + `aria-labelledby`, sidebar `aria-current="page"`, autosave `aria-live="polite"` regions. Formal WCAG 2.2 audit deferred but the worst gaps are closed.

See [`docs/12-operating-manual.md`](docs/12-operating-manual.md) for the step-by-step operator flow. Observation-mode deployments render none of the directive surface — the `/directive` route returns 404 at the route-loader level.

## Access you need

Before clicking Deploy, confirm you have **both** of the following. Without them the deploy won't finish, or the post-deploy setup wizard won't be able to create the Entra apps.

### Azure subscription — to provision the infrastructure

Either:
- **Contributor** on the subscription (or the target resource group), OR
- A custom role with create/write rights on: `Microsoft.App/managedEnvironments`, `Microsoft.App/containerApps`, `Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks`, `Microsoft.Network/privateEndpoints`, `Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones`, `Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts`, `Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces`.

The template also creates role assignments between the Container App, the VNet, and the Storage account — that requires Contributor-equivalent permission at the resource-group scope. **Reader** is not enough.

Quick check:
```sh
az role assignment list --assignee $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv) \
  --scope /subscriptions/<sub-id> --query "[].roleDefinitionName" -o tsv
```

### Microsoft Entra tenant — to create the two app registrations

The first-run wizard's **Create for me** buttons do this via device-code flow. Whoever approves the device code on their browser needs one of:
- **Application Administrator** (minimum — can create app registrations + client secrets), OR
- **Cloud Application Administrator**, OR
- **Global Administrator**.

To **grant admin consent** to each newly-created app afterwards (one button click in Entra portal), one of:
- **Privileged Role Administrator**, OR
- **Cloud Application Administrator**, OR
- **Global Administrator**.

In practice most operators use Global Admin for the whole setup to avoid juggling roles.

### Per-entity onboarding (later, not during first-run)

When you onboard each entity onto Mizan, that entity's **Global Administrator** (not yours) must click the consent URL Mizan generates for them. This is a one-time click per entity, done in the entity's own tenant.

---

## Deploy

### <a name="azure"></a>🚀 Azure (recommended)

Click the button above. Azure portal opens with the template pre-loaded — fill in two fields and click Create. Works on any subscription (including MCA-managed and policy-locked tenants) because the template uses NFS-mounted Azure Files, which doesn't rely on shared-key auth.

Or via CLI:

```sh
az group create -n mizan-rg -l uaenorth
az deployment group create \
    -g mizan-rg \
    --template-file web/deploy/azure-container-apps.bicep \
    --parameters appBaseUrl=https://posture.example.com
```

After the deployment completes (~3 min), click **Go to resource**. You'll land on the **Deployment overview** page — find the `dashboardUrl` in the **Outputs** section (left sidebar). Paste it in a new browser tab. First load takes ~30s (container cold-start), then the `/setup` wizard fires.

Alternate path to the same URL: Resource group → Container App (`mizan-app-<random>`) → **Application URL** in the top-right.

**What gets provisioned:**
- Virtual network with two subnets (ACA-delegated + private-endpoint)
- Premium FileStorage account (NFS-enabled, public network access disabled, shared-key disabled)
- Private DNS zone `privatelink.file.core.windows.net` + private endpoint for SMB-free mounts
- Log Analytics workspace for app logs
- VNet-integrated Container Apps managed environment (Consumption profile) + Container App — pulls the public image from ghcr.io, no registry setup on your side
- HTTPS ingress with auto-managed TLS

Cost: ~$35–55/month for a single-customer install (Premium FileStorage minimum ~100GB is the main uplift).

### Changing the dashboard URL after the first deploy

The ACA-assigned URL (`https://mizan-app-xxx.region.azurecontainerapps.io`) works out of the box. Three ways to swap it for something nicer later:

**Option 1 — Bind a custom domain to the Container App (recommended)**
1. Buy/own the DNS for `posture.yourcompany.gov.ae`
2. Azure portal → your Container App → **Custom domains** → **Add custom domain**
3. Pick **Managed certificate** (Azure auto-issues + renews the cert)
4. Add the CNAME Azure shows you to your DNS provider; wait ~2 min for validation
5. Done. Both the new domain and the original `.azurecontainerapps.io` URL keep working

**Option 2 — Put a Cloudflare tunnel / Azure Front Door in front**
Zero ACA config change needed. Mizan's runtime resolver picks up the incoming `Host` / `X-Forwarded-Host` header automatically.

**Option 3 — Explicit override**
Container App → **Containers** → **Environment variables** → add `APP_BASE_URL=https://posture.yourcompany.gov.ae` → **Save**. Triggers a rolling revision (~30s) and pins the URL regardless of incoming headers.

**Whichever option you use** — after the URL changes, you **must** also update the redirect URI on your **User Auth** Entra app (Entra portal → App registrations → your user-auth app → **Authentication** → update the Web redirect URI to `https://<new-url>/api/auth/user-callback`). Entra does exact-match, so a mismatch breaks sign-in with `AADSTS50011: redirect URI mismatch`.

### <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting Azure deployments

The deployment completed but the URL returns nothing / times out? Walk through these in order.

#### 1. Is the container actually running?

Azure portal → Container App → **Revisions and replicas**. You want `Healthy` + 1/1 replicas.

If you see `Unhealthy` + 0/1 replicas with a container stuck in `Waiting / PodInitializing`, read on.

#### 2. NFS mount failure (rare — Premium FileStorage SKU unavailable)

```sh
az login
az containerapp logs show -n <mizan-app-name> -g <your-rg> --type system --tail 30
```

If you see `MountVolume.SetUp failed` with NFS-specific errors, the most common cause is Premium_LRS FileStorage not being available in the chosen region. Check:
```sh
az rest --method GET \
  --url "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<sub>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/skus?api-version=2023-01-01" \
  --query "value[?kind=='FileStorage' && tier=='Premium']" -o table
```
If Premium isn't available in your region, redeploy in a nearby region that supports it (every major Azure region does, including `uaenorth`, `westeurope`, `eastus`, `northeurope`).

Cleanup commands if you need to redeploy:
```sh
RG=<your-rg>
az containerapp delete          -n <mizan-app-name>     -g $RG --yes
az containerapp env delete      -n <mizan-env-name>     -g $RG --yes
az network private-endpoint delete -n <mizan-pe-file-name> -g $RG
az network vnet delete          -n <mizan-vnet-name>    -g $RG
az storage account delete       -n <mizan-storage-name> -g $RG --yes
az monitor log-analytics workspace delete -n <mizan-law-name> -g $RG --force true --yes
az network private-dns zone delete -n privatelink.file.core.windows.net -g $RG --yes
```

#### 3. Image pull failure

Log stream shows `Failed to pull image` or `ErrImagePull`. Verify the public image is reachable:
```sh
curl -fsS "https://ghcr.io/token?scope=repository:ohomaidi/mizan:pull&service=ghcr.io" >/dev/null && echo "token OK"
```
If the image somehow regressed to private on GHCR, flip it back to public at **github.com/users/ohomaidi/packages/container/mizan/settings** → Danger Zone.

#### 4. Liveness probe timeouts

Logs show `Readiness probe failed` or `Liveness probe failed` repeatedly. The NFS variant already bumps the probe generosity (initialDelaySeconds=30, timeoutSeconds=5, failureThreshold=5). If the legacy variant is hitting probe timeouts, update:
```sh
az containerapp update -n <mizan-app-name> -g <your-rg> \
    --set-env-vars NODE_ENV=production
# probes are set via the Bicep, easier to redeploy than patch them live
```

#### 5. "Kubernetes error happened. Closing the connection." when opening Log stream

That's ACA's way of saying no replica is running — the container failed before stdout could open. Use the system logs (`az containerapp logs show ... --type system`) or the **Revisions and replicas** page. Don't try to stream app logs until at least one replica is healthy.

#### 6. `AADSTS50011: redirect URI mismatch` on sign-in

The URL Mizan is running at doesn't match the redirect URI you registered on the Entra user-auth app. Update the Entra app's Web redirect URI to `https://<your-actual-url>/api/auth/user-callback`. See [Changing the dashboard URL](#changing-the-dashboard-url-after-the-first-deploy) above.

#### 6a. After sign-in, browser lands on `https://0.0.0.0:8787/` and times out

You're on a pre-v1.1.2 image behind a reverse proxy that doesn't forward `Host` cleanly — the OIDC callback built the post-sign-in redirect off the container's internal bind address instead of the public FQDN. Fix in two steps:

1. Upgrade to `:1.1.2` or newer — every outbound redirect now resolves through `APP_BASE_URL` → `x-forwarded-host` → `Host`.
2. Set `APP_BASE_URL` explicitly on the Container App so the base URL is deterministic:

```sh
az containerapp update -n <mizan-app-name> -g <your-rg> \
    --image ghcr.io/ohomaidi/mizan:latest \
    --set-env-vars APP_BASE_URL=https://<your-fqdn>
```

#### 7. `AADSTS65001: admin has not consented` on sign-in (or user gets a consent prompt that errors out)

You skipped the admin-consent step after auto-provisioning. Open Entra admin center → **App registrations** → your user-auth app → **API permissions** → **Grant admin consent for \<tenant\>** → confirm every permission shows Status *"Granted for \<tenant\>"* in green. Retry sign-in.

#### 8. `AADSTS50194: Application is not configured as a multi-tenant application` on sign-in

The stored tenantId on the user-auth app is `common` but the app itself is single-tenant (`AzureADMyOrg`). Fixed in v1.0.5 — make sure you're running `ghcr.io/ohomaidi/mizan:latest` or `:1.0.5` and re-run the wizard's Step 4. If you previously ran an older build that saved `tenantId: common`, `az containerapp update --image ghcr.io/ohomaidi/mizan:latest` to pull the fix, then open **Settings → Authentication** and re-enter the correct tenant GUID (Entra portal → Overview → Tenant ID).

#### 9. `AADSTS50076: multi-factor authentication required` when running `az` commands

Your tenant enforces MFA on management operations. The CLI surfaces the specific `az login` command to run in the error message — paste it verbatim, complete MFA in the browser, retry.

#### 8. Deployment gets stuck "InProgress" for >15 min

Most likely a prerequisite resource hit a policy block. Run:
```sh
az deployment group show -n <deployment-name> -g <your-rg> --query "properties.error"
```
The error usually points at the resource type and policy reason.

### <a name="macos"></a>🖥 macOS

For on-prem labs, airgapped review stations, and demos.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ohomaidi/Mizan.git
cd Mizan
VERSION=2.0.0 bash web/deploy/mac-build.sh
# Output: web/deploy/dist/posture-dashboard-2.0.0.pkg
#
# Note: the build artefact + install path still use the legacy
# "posture-dashboard" identifier from before the Mizan rebrand. The
# UI is fully Mizan-branded; only the file/path names are legacy.
# Renaming would break the in-place upgrade path for existing installs;
# planned in a future release alongside a migration script.
```

Double-clicking the `.pkg` on the target Mac:

- Drops the app at `/usr/local/posture-dashboard/`
- Installs a LaunchAgent that starts it on login (http://localhost:8787)
- Creates `~/Library/Application Support/posture-dashboard/` for the SQLite DB + uploaded logos
- Writes `~/Desktop/posture-dashboard-CREDENTIALS.txt` with first-run instructions — auto-opens when the installer finishes

---

### Windows

**Native Windows install is not supported (dropped in v2.5.14).** Operators on Windows hosts run Mizan inside Docker Desktop or WSL2 — same image, same upgrade path as Linux Docker. The `.msi` packaging pipeline was repeatedly broken in CI and we made the call to remove it rather than ship a half-working installer.

```powershell
docker run -p 8787:8787 -v mizan_data:/data ghcr.io/ohomaidi/mizan:latest
```

---

## Upgrading an existing install

New releases are published to `ghcr.io/ohomaidi/mizan` with both a `:latest` tag and an explicit semver tag (`:1.1.2`, `:1.2.0`, etc.). The in-app **Settings → About → Check for updates** panel polls GitHub Releases and tells you when a new version is available; applying the update is a one-command roll.

### Azure Container Apps

From any shell with `az` installed and `az login` completed:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohomaidi/Mizan/main/web/deploy/update-azure.sh \
    | bash -s -- --tag 1.1.2
```

The script auto-discovers the Container App in the current subscription, derives `APP_BASE_URL` from the ingress FQDN, and applies the update idempotently. Zero flags needed in the common case. Pass `--rg <group> --app <name>` to override auto-discovery if you have multiple Mizan installs in one subscription.

Manual equivalent:

```sh
az containerapp update \
  --name <your-mizan-app-name> \
  --resource-group <your-rg> \
  --image ghcr.io/ohomaidi/mizan:1.1.2 \
  --set-env-vars APP_BASE_URL=https://<your-fqdn>
```

A new revision rolls in ~30–60 s; your `/data` Azure Files mount carries the SQLite database + uploaded logo untouched — no data migration step.

### macOS on-prem installer

Re-run the builder script from the latest `main`, then re-install the produced `.pkg`. The installer places files over the existing install and preserves `~/Library/Application Support/mizan/` so the SQLite DB and logo survive.

```sh
git pull && bash web/deploy/mac-build.sh
sudo installer -pkg web/deploy/dist/mizan-1.1.2.pkg -target /
```

(Or just download the latest `.pkg` from the GitHub Releases page — the in-app **Settings → About** panel surfaces a one-click download button.)

### Upgrading from v1.0.x to v1.1 — one breaking change

The `enforce` sign-in toggle is gone. Sign-in is always required in v1.1. If you had `enforce=false` on your v1.0.x deployment (the default — most installs), three things happen after the update:

1. Any cached session you had keeps working until it expires.
2. Anonymous requests to dashboard pages (`/entities`, `/settings`, etc.) now redirect to `/login`.
3. Until the first admin in your `users` table signs in successfully, the bootstrap escape hatch keeps the dashboard open — so nobody is locked out during the transition.

If your ACA deployment has `APP_BASE_URL` unset in env (the old default), set it during the upgrade — the update script does this automatically. Without it you may hit the post-signin `0.0.0.0:8787` redirect bug documented in troubleshooting §6a.

---

## First-run setup

Every install drops the operator on a 5-step setup wizard at `/setup`:

| Step | What it captures |
|---|---|
| 1 | Organization name (EN + AR), short form, framework (NESA / NCA / ISR / Generic) |
| 2 | Logo upload — background auto-removed locally via a bundled U-2-Netp ONNX model (no cloud, no Python) |
| 3 | Graph-signals Entra app (multi-tenant, for reading posture) — **"Create for me" auto-provisions the app + secret via Microsoft device-code flow; no Azure portal clicks needed** |
| 4 | User sign-in Entra app (single-tenant, for staff sign-in) — same auto-provision flow |
| 5 | Bootstrap admin — the first account to complete sign-in is promoted to admin automatically |

Steps 2–5 are all skippable — configure them from Settings anytime.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/setup-wizard.png" alt="First-run setup wizard" width="700" />
</p>

### ⚠ Grant admin consent after auto-provisioning — required before Step 5

The wizard creates both Entra apps for you and stores the credentials, but **Microsoft requires a human admin to approve the permissions in the Entra portal**. There is no Graph API that can do this for you. **Do this before clicking *Sign in and become admin* on Step 5**, otherwise the sign-in round-trip fails with `AADSTS65001: admin has not consented` and drops you out of the wizard.

**Step-by-step, right after Step 4 of the wizard finishes:**

1. **User-auth app** — required for staff sign-in.
   - Entra admin center → **App registrations** → open the app named `<your short form> — User Auth` (e.g. `Mizan — User Auth`)
   - Left menu → **API permissions**
   - Click **Grant admin consent for \<your tenant\>** → confirm
   - Every row (User.Read / openid / profile / email) flips to Status *"Granted for &lt;tenant&gt;"* in green

2. **Graph-signals app** — required **per connected entity**, not in your operator tenant.
   - For each entity you onboard later, Mizan generates an Onboarding Letter PDF with a per-entity admin-consent URL
   - Send it to the entity's Global Admin — one click in their tenant grants consent for the 18 read-only Graph permissions
   - Consent in your operator tenant is only needed if you want to read posture from your *own* tenant as a test

3. **(Optional) Custom roles** — if you want Admin / Analyst / Viewer separation driven by Entra rather than Mizan's internal RBAC:
   - App registrations → User-auth app → **App roles** → define `Posture.Admin`, `Posture.Analyst`, `Posture.Viewer`
   - Enterprise applications → User-auth app → **Users and groups** → assign users to roles

Mizan's bootstrap-admin flow still applies: the first successful Microsoft sign-in becomes admin automatically. The consent step above isn't about who's admin — it's about Microsoft letting the sign-in happen at all.

### Branded sign-in + user management
Entra ID sign-in, Admin / Analyst / Viewer roles, invite-by-email. **Sign-in is always required** — the first-run wizard auto-provisions the Entra app and auto-signs-in the operator as admin via device-code flow. Subsequent users sign in via Microsoft SSO. Session is a 7-day sliding window by default (configurable 8h / 24h / 7d / 30d in Settings → Authentication); when it lapses, Microsoft SSO silently re-issues a session — no password prompt unless cookies were cleared.

- **VNet-integrated ACA env** — the managed environment is attached to the `aca` subnet; the container reaches storage via a private endpoint in the `pe` subnet, so storage never has a public exposure.
- **NFS for persistence** — `Premium_LRS` FileStorage mounted at `/data`. SQLite (signals, users, config) + the uploaded logo live here. Survives container restarts and revision swaps.
- **Why NFS and not SMB** — many Azure tenants enforce `StorageAccount_DisableLocalAuth_Modify` policy that silently disables shared-key auth. SMB needs shared-key; NFS uses network-level auth via the private endpoint, so the deploy works under any governance posture.
- **Daily sync** — one `POST /api/sync` per day pulls all 18 Graph signals from every consented entity with a 5-worker pool.
- **Two deployment modes** — `observation` uses only `.Read` Graph scopes. `directive` provisions a second Entra app with write scopes for the shipped directive surfaces (reactive actions + Conditional Access policy push + rollback). Mode is fixed at install time via `MIZAN_DEPLOYMENT_MODE` and cannot be toggled at runtime — switching modes is a redeploy.

**On the Mac installer**: same Next.js app + SQLite, but `DATA_DIR` points at `~/Library/Application Support/mizan/`. No VNet, no NFS — local filesystem directly.

See [docs/04-architecture-and-risks.md](docs/04-architecture-and-risks.md) for the full breakdown including the multi-tenant Graph auth model, throttling envelope, failure modes, and production hardening checklist.
