// Rule for this project: **product names stay in English**, always.
//   - Top-level nav labels (Maturity overview, Entities, Identity, Threats, ...)
//   - Feature/product names (Secure Score, Defender, Purview, Entra ID, Intune, ...)
//   - Entity proper names (Sharjah Police, SEWA, ...) — come from data layer as-is.
//
// What IS translated: page headings, descriptions, column headers, button labels,
// KPI labels, status words, empty-state copy.

The dashboard creates a pending tenant record, generates a unique admin-consent URL, and produces a personalized PDF with the consent URL embedded. {orgShort} sends that PDF to the entity's Global Administrator, who clicks the consent URL, signs in with their tenant's Global Admin account, and approves the read-only Graph permissions.

      "Access to Microsoft admin portals (Entra admin, Azure portal, Defender XDR, Intune, Exchange admin, SharePoint admin, M365 admin) requires a compliant or hybrid-joined device. Prevents admin tasks from a personal / unmanaged endpoint.",
    "baseline.compliantDeviceAdminPortals.why":
